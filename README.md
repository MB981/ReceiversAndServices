Broadcast Receivers:
Broadcast receivers are used to subscribe to system events, allowing the application to react to changes in the device's state. In this application, a broadcast receiver is registered to listen for changes in the Airplane mode status. When the Airplane mode is turned on, the application displays a toast message indicating that the device is in Airplane mode. Conversely, when the Airplane mode is turned off, another toast message is displayed indicating that the device is not in Airplane mode. This functionality is achieved by subscribing to the Intent.ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED broadcast action.

Foreground Services:
Foreground services are used to perform long-running tasks that are visible to the user, even when the application is in the background. In this application, a foreground service is started when the application is opened. The service is responsible for continuously monitoring the Airplane mode status, ensuring that the user receives real-time updates even when the application is not actively in use. Additionally, a notification is displayed in the status bar to indicate that the service is running in the foreground. When the application is closed or destroyed, the service continues to run in the background, ensuring that the user remains informed about the Airplane mode status. Upon closing the service, the notification in the status bar is also removed, providing a seamless user experience.
